Created with the main goal of learning how to use tailwindcss for future coding challenges and to add more to my CV to help get a dev job.

# Challenges

To use flex and learn how to place objects.
Customize colours and font styles.
Add images and effects.
Understand they key codes used in the tailwind documentation.

Add some js too to make it more reactive.

I would like to learn this so I can participate in frontend challenges on the icodethis platform.

# Credits

I will be following the code ninja videos and tailwind documentation
